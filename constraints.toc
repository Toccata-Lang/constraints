;; defined for almost everything
;; type ops may not be intersected with each other.
;; ComputedConstraint may not be intersected with itself
;; intersecting anything with a ComputedConstraint appends the constraint
;; intersecting anything with a ParamConstraint produces a ComputedConstraint with ParamConstraint first
